This code can be used to simulate  N-body systems of particles interacting under a number of user-defined conditions. This file contains:
    - Lennard_Jones.py - contains function for finding force, potential and kinetic energy in an N-body system.
    - ParticleManyBody.py - our main function.
    - observables.py - contains function for applying periodic bundary conditions and minimum image convention and for finding mean squared distance.
    - Particle3D.py -  contains class that creates our particles
    - input parameter text files:

The command line takes the following arguments
- Input parameters text file
- trajectory data file traj.xyz

Input text files are formatted as follows:

Number of particles
Density
Temperature 
Cutoff distance
Step number 
Timestep 
Number of histogram bins



We hope you enjoy reading it as much as we did coding it!
